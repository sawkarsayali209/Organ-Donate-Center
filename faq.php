        <p><strong>Can anyone donate?</strong></p>
        <p>Anyone between the age of 15 and 80 inclusive can donate organs. Just fill out the required information under our register tab. If you are older or younger than our required age range, then we can refer you to another agency that can help you.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I register as a recipient if I need an organ?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, we assist both individuals who want to donate and individuals who need an organ.</p>
        <p><strong>Which organs can I donate?</strong></p>
        <p>You can donate a heart, liver, lung, or kidney. We do not handle tissue donations.</p>
        <p><strong>Do I need to be a citizen of India to donate?</strong></p>
        <p>Although some other organizations allow non-citizens to donate, we only allow Indian citizens to donate.</p>
        <p><strong>How long will it take to receive my needed organ?</strong></p>
        <p>This depends on if the organ you need is readily available and where you are located. Many factors affect how long the wait may be for an organ.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I see the waitlist?</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we do not let our patients view the waitlist as this information is confidential. However, we will assist you with acquiring your needed organ as fast as we can.</p>
        <p><strong>If I or a family member is unconscious, and I need someone to make a decision for me on donating organs, what should I do?</strong></p>
        <p>While you sign up for donating organs, you can choose to select a family member, spouse, or trusted individual to make that decision for you.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you have any religious affiliation?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, we are a catholic organization. However, we accept patients of all racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds and make it our mission to help all who seek help.</p>
